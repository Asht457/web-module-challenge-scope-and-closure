/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
  
  counter1 has a nested function that altars the variable 'count' contained within the function 'counterMaker', this version of the count variable is only accessible from scopes within the function, it cannot be changed or referenced by outside sources.
  counter2 is a single function that altars a variable declared in the global scope, this variable can be referenced and edited from anywhere in the program. 
  
  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
  
  Both of these are examples of closure, in counter1 the nested function 'Counter' executes code that references a variable outside of itself. The variable 'count' is declared in the 'counterMaker'function, which is essentially one scope level up from the actual counter1 function.

  counter2 is basically doing the same thing, it's accessing a variable that has been declared outside of its scope, it's little contained block, only in this scenario the variable it's referencing is declared in the global scope.

  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?  

     If you want to keep your count variable restricted to only be referenced or edited by code contained within the scope of that specific function, you would use counter1, if you want multiple functions to reference and possibly edit your count variable you would use counter2.
     let say you are creating a game, you have two players who each build up their own points and you want to see a combined total of their points, lets say it's a cooperative game and once both players reach a combined score of 10 you win. 
     counter1 has a private variable that can keep track of it's own score, only counter1 can change it's own count variable, so this setup would be ideal for creating the individual player scores as they are contained within themselves and not accessible outside of their own scope.
     counter2 could be altared by multiple sources, so if I make a function for player1 and player2, they can both make changes to the count variable as it is stored in the global scope, so they both have access to it. so player1 gains a point, it increases count by 1, count now = 1, player 2 then gets a point, it increases the same variable by 1 so now count = 2, you cannot do that with counter1 because player2 wouldn't be able to reach inside of player1 to access that counter.
*/

// counter1 code
function counterMaker() {
  let count = 0;
  return function counter() {
   return count++;
  }
}

const counter1 = counterMaker();

// counter2 code
let count = 0;

function counter2() {
  return count++;
}


/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 2: inning() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2
  
NOTE: This will be a callback function for the tasks below
*/

function inning(){
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
}
console.log(inning());


/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 3: finalScore() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 in the first parameter
  2. Receive a number of innings to be played in the second parameter
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played
  
  For example: invoking finalScore(inning, 9) might return this object:
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5
}
*/ 

function finalScore(/*Code Here*/){
  /*Code Here*/
}


/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 4: getInningScore() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the getInningScore() function below to do the following:
  1. Receive a callback function in a parameter - you will pass in the inning function from task 2 as your argument 
  2. Return an object with a score for home and a score for away that populates from invoking the inning callback function 
  
For example: invoking getInningScore(inning) might return this object:
{
  "Home": 0,
  "Away": 2
}
  */


function getInningScore(/*Your Code Here */) {
  /*Your Code Here */

}


/* STRETCH: ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 5: scoreboard() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function in the first parameter that will take `getInningScore` from Task 4 as its argument
  2. Receive the callback function in a second parameter that will take `inning` from Task 2 as its argument
  3. Receive a number in a third parameter that will take the number of innings to be played as its argument
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cummulative score (see the example below).
  5. If there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 3: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 4: Away 2 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 5: Away 2 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 6: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 7: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 8: Away 2 - Home 2",
  "Inning 9: Away 1 - Home 0", 
  "Final Score: Away 11 - Home 12"  
]

  TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 2",
  "Inning 3: Away 1 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 4: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 5: Away 0 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 6: Away 2 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 7: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 8: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 9: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "This game will require extra innings: Away 10 - Home 10"
] */
